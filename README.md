# Ping

Ping is a solution that implements pairing system technology to tackle the security issues surrounding University Students in Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University(ATBU). Students over the years have been attacked on their way to school or on their way home(especially in the night) due poor security system of the university and also due to individual journey to respective destination. Pink is an app we build to tackle this problem by pairing students with similar interest or destination in order to enable them communicate and also reach thier destination in group rather than individual(vunerable to attacks).

## Feedbacks
1. James Angulu(400 level Engineering student):- The app was of uttermost help to me and my friends, we can now move together at night to our homes safely without attacks, all we have to do is to use the app to check if any of us is ready to hit the road even though we read at different locations, we could just check each other out and plan a departure time and hit the road together. I now feel safe moving in group than individually.

2. Jocinta Emmanuel(100 level science student):- This app came at the right time, i used to be scared whenever i plan to get to school for a read, but using this app enabled me to check out students planing to enter school thesame time with me, we just chat on the app, meet at a secure location and get moving. Thanks Ping team !!!

3. Ismail Mohammed:- Alhamdullah!!, i'm so happy one of us came up with solution to the security problem in our school, this will come a long way to reduce attacks on students, i hope the school also join hands to support them. Well done guys.
